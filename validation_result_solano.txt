Abstract
In the poultry industry, the meat market requires a careful coordination of the broiler chicken supply chain
comprising breeders, hatcheries, farms, slaughterhouses, wholesale, and retail vendors. Aside from the in-
herent challenges of coordinating a supply chain, animal husbandry systems face additional complex tasks.
The lack of integrated decisions within the poultry chain could lead to a production plan that (a) does not
comply with the biosecurity standards required in meat production for human consumption at the farms; (b)
violates the production and inventory capacities at the slaughterhouses; and (c) does not meet the demand
of customers. To streamline the supply chain, we propose a mixed-integer linear programming model that
supports production planning and scheduling decisions in broiler chicken production facilities. In addition,
we embedded the mixed-integer programming model in a rolling-horizon scheme to improve scalability and
to avoid the myopic eﬀect of time-indexed optimization models that put too much emphasis on a speciﬁc
time period. We present the results of a case study in a poultry company in Santa Marta (Colombia), where
we reach proﬁt improvements that range from 7% to 57% with a reduction in inventory costs that range from
30% to 60%, while simultaneously meeting stringent technical, tactical, and biosecurity constraints.

Fig. 1. Broiler chicken meat supply chain.
1. Introduction
In 2018, the poultry sector produced 123.9 million tons of poultry meat leading the market with
a 36% of the global meat production (FAO, 2019b). In the same year, it was the most consumed
meat in the world and its demand shows an increasing trend of over 1% per year (OECD and FAO,
2019). This trend can be explained by a shift in the preference of customers and the accessibility
over other competing types of meat such as pork or beef.
Within the poultry sector, the chicken meat production system has the largest share.Broiler chick-
ens are especially raised for meat production and have been enhanced by breeding over decades.
These breeds represent less costs for farmers, as they show high food-meat conversion rates that
make them grow quickly with less food (Zuidhof et al., 2014). In 2017, broiler chicken meat pro-
duction accounted for 89% of the world’s poultry production (FAO, 2019a). Moreover, production
and demand of broiler chicken meat products increased by 7% (about 7000 metric tons) in the last
ﬁve years (USDA, 2019). Therefore, meeting the demand of broiler chicken meat is essential to
guarantee food security and any eﬀort to increase the eﬃciency of its supply chain contributes to
global economic growth.
The structure of the broiler chicken supply chain and its degree of integration vary among coun-
tries and ﬁrms. Such a structure has changed throughout the years favoring large-scale vertically
integrated operations of the supply chain (Narrod et al., 2008). Figure 1 shows the general struc-
ture of this agri-chain. At the beginning of the chain, breeders and hatcheries produce batches of
day-old chickens that are sent to farms. Once in the farms, day-old chickens are ﬂoor-raised on
litter (e.g., made from rice hulls) at open structures known as grow-out houses. Chickens are grain-
fed, with feed provided by mills, until they reach slaughter weight targeted in terms of animal age
(i.e., six weeks). Slaughterhouses then receive these mature chickens from farms and turn them into
multiple products for wholesalers, which then distribute them to retailers and customers.
In developing countries, the majority of poultry production is oﬀered by small-to-medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs). For instance, in Colombia, poultry SMEs represented 58% of the sector in the

period between 2013 and 2017 (Rivera-Godoy and Rendón-Perea, 2019). In a context of growing
markets and a more intensive and industrialized production, such SMEs must develop strategies
to enhance their competitiveness (Mcleod et al., 2009). One plausible plan is the integration of
the supply chain, which, in the poultry sector, implies the collaboration between farms and meat
processing facilities. Such cooperation can provide either a vertical integration of large companies
with farms or contractual relationships where farms supply services to integrators (OECD, 2018).
On the other hand, intensiﬁcation is another strategy that improves economies of scale in SMEs
(Robinson et al., 2011) by lowering costs and allowing access to better technology and management
practices. In any case, such strategies increase the complexity of the operations and quantitative
analytical methods are then required to make better decisions.
Hence, integrated production planning in the broiler chicken supply chain requires a careful
coordination to guarantee not only proﬁtability and high-quality standards but also animal welfare
(Allender and Richards, 2010; Tonsor and Olynk, 2011). Good living conditions assure biosecurity
measures (Siekkinen et al., 2012; Van Limbergen et al., 2018), prevent and control diseases in birds,
and enable sustainable practices (Leinonen and Kyriazakis, 2016), which lead to environmentally
and economically viable systems.
For a mid-term (i.e., 6- to 12-month) production plan at the farm level, managers must make sev-
eral tactical and interweaved decisions. Primarily, they must determine the batch size of chicken lots
arriving from hatcheries; and the allocation of these lots to grow-out houses of diﬀerent sections or
farms with varying capacities, while meeting biosecurity constraints. In addition, if the operation
in the slaughterhouse is integrated with the farm operation, the production plan should adjust to
both the forecast demand of broiler meat products and the slaughterhouse capacity to fulﬁll the
stock policies. At the end, managers are required to produce a proﬁtable plan that keep ﬁnancial
and environmental costs under control.
The planning complexity in the broiler chicken supply chain provides fertile ground for the use
of operational research (OR) to support decisions in this agricultural system. Since the early 1950s,
OR-based approaches have been applied in agricultural systems to solve decision problems facing
large-scale, social, and environmental complexities (Carravilla and Oliveira, 2013). Plà-Aragonés
(2015), Weintraub and Romero (2006), Higgins et al. (2010), Bjørndal et al. (2012), and Kusumas-
tuti et al. (2016) have reviewed applications of OR in agriculture to manage resources and to solve
planning problems in crops and meat industries using techniques such as linear programming (LP),
simulation, risk analysis, stochastic programming, and metaheuristics, among others.
Several applications of OR in the meat sector have been developed for the pig industry. Plà-
Aragonés and Rodríguez-Sánchez (2015) and Khamjan et al. (2013) focused on the transportation
of pigs to the slaughterhouse considering decisions at the farm level. Rodríguez-Sánchez et al.
(2012) modeled tactical decisions at sow farms to produce piglets for the pig supply chain. Nadal-
Roig and Plà (2014) developed a production planning tool based on LP for a multiperiod multisite
pig production system. Finally, Albornoz et al. (2014) presented a mixed-integer linear program for
pork production and cutting that focuses on the slaughterhouse operation.
Some researchers have employed OR techniques to enhance the poultry industry competitive-
ness. For instance, Taube-Netto (1996) developed an integrated production planning system for
a leading Brazilian company. The author used a modular system to determine lot sizes, alloca-
tion decisions, slaughtering operations, and shift plans. Although the article presents an overview
of the methodology, it does not cover the details of the models. It is worth noting that the sheer

size of the company and the integrated structure does not ﬁt most poultry ﬁrms in the indus-
try. Oliveira and Lindau (2012) proposed a scheduling methodology for the collection of chickens
at the farm level to reduce the waiting times of birds before their transportation to a slaughter-
house with capacity constraints. For egg-laying chickens, which are raised for egg production (not
meat consumption), Boonmee et al. (2015) used a hybrid clustering heuristic to minimize trans-
portation distances and to avoid mixing hen ages allocated in the same cages. Later, Boonmee
and Sethanan (2016) developed a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for solving
small instances of a lot-sizing problem (i.e., with a planning horizon (PH) of up to 20 weeks)
and then a particle swarm optimization approach to tackle larger instances. More recently, Bre-
vik et al. (2020) presented an MILP model for the integration in the broiler chicken industry with
an emphasis on the connection between hatcheries and farms. The authors also presented rolling-
horizon (RH) heuristics to eﬃciently solve the instances due to the computational burden of the
MILP model.
The literature lacks work on integrated production planning and scheduling in the broiler chicken
supply chain where farms and slaughterhouses are tightly coordinated. This paper aims to ﬁll this
gap by extending the work outlined by the authors in BigDSSAgro held in Valparaiso (Chile) in
2019 (Solano-Blanco et al., 2020). This work presents an optimization-based decision support tool
that tackles strategic, tactical, and operational decisions in a poultry company with integrated op-
erations among its farms and slaughterhouse facilities.
The remaining structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents the integrated production
planning problem for broiler chickens. In Section 3, we present the MILP model that provides a
production plan. Section 4 presents the case study. Section 5 presents both computational experi-
ments on diﬀerent instances of a Colombian poultry company with vertical integration (farm and
slaughterhouse) and a comparative analysis using a rolling-horizon heuristic and a sensitivity anal-
ysis on the demand. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper and outlines future work.
2. The broiler chicken production problem
We study the broiler chicken supply chain where production and inventory decisions are made
by the same decision maker at the farm, slaughterhouse, and wholesale level. The hatcheries and
feed manufacturers are suppliers of day-old chicken and chicken feed, respectively. These sourcing
options have suﬃcient capacity, provided purchase orders are sent to suppliers with enough time in
advance. In general, hatcheries expect purchase orders six months ahead of time so they can plan
and adjust their production of day-old chicken lots. Therefore, a decision support tool for planning
poultry operations is critical to run eﬃciently, this supply chain and negotiating economic deals
with hatcheries and feeding mills.
In this vertically integrated context, decisions made at the farm level have a tremendous impact
and propagate throughout the whole supply chain. Speciﬁcally, the lot sizing and assignment of
day-old chicken lots to grow-out houses have a cascade eﬀect in the poultry chain. Such resource
allocation decisions must consider not only the operational conditions in the farm but also the
capacity of the slaughterhouse and the demand of chicken meat products at the wholesale level.
Thus, the coordinated ﬂow of material and information between these echelons of the poultry sup-
ply chain makes production planning a challenging problem for any company.

Fig. 2. Life cycle of the broiler chicken in a grow-out house.
Figure 2 shows the typical life cycle of the broiler chicken under consideration. Operations at
the farm begin with the arrival of day-old chicken lots. These lots are allocated in grow-out houses
where they stay until completing their life cycle and are taken to the slaughterhouse. In the grow-
out houses, chickens are provided with water, food, and a controlled microclimate. The ﬁrst two
weeks are crucial since mortality and food-meat conversion rates are particularly high. If chickens
are conﬁned to a high density (chickens/m 2), their stress levels increase while their conversion rate
and meat quality decrease (Estevez, 2007). Overcrowding can even cause a signiﬁcant increase in
mortality rates, yet lower densities increase costs of chicken raising.
Meeting biosecurity measures improve animal welfare and guarantee meat quality for human
consumption. For this reason, it is of utmost importance that broiler chickens allocated at the
same grow-out house have the same age, so vaccines can be scheduled accordingly. By doing so,
there are lower chances of proliferation of diseases, which can greatly aﬀect the whole farm and
its surroundings. Since chickens are mainly aﬀected by airborne diseases or through tools used by
employees, it is advisable to have homogeneous and separated lots. Consequently, poultry farms are
often geographically divided into smaller areas called sections comprising grow-out houses located
nearby. Figure 3 shows an example of a case of a farm with 11 grow-out houses distributed into
ﬁve sections.
Conﬁning chickens into sections is a good poultry farming practice. Aside from avoiding cross-
contamination, which is a major biosecurity concern, sections can also increase productivity. Since
the idea is that grow-out houses in one section are ﬁlled with day-old chicken in the shortest possi-
ble time, nearby chickens are going to reach their slaughter weight roughly at the same time. When
the slaughter time comes, it then requires less eﬀort to load trucks and ship chickens to the slaugh-
terhouse. Once chickens leave the farm, cleaning and sanitation processes start simultaneously at all
grow-out houses of the same section, so to get ready for a new production cycle as early as possible.
These processes require a rest period where no chicken lots are assigned to the section.
In the meat market, consumers value freshness and short storage times. A good coordination
between farm and slaughterhouse operations often translate into low inventories and cost reduc-
tions. A good ﬂow of information allows for a smooth reaction to demand ﬂuctuations and to
adjust operations to avoid under- or oversupply. Slaughterhouses store chicken meat products in
compartmentalized cold rooms that operate based on the inventory levels and their safety stock. In
practice, if inventory levels are kept low, close to the safety stock, product freshness is guaranteed
and storage costs reduced.
In summary, an eﬃcient broiler chicken supply chain relies on coordinated farm, slaughterhouse,
and wholesale operations. Given the farm layout (i.e., distribution of sections and grow-out houses),

the broiler chicken production problem consists of determining the size of day-old chicken lots to
order from hatcheries and the grow-out house assignment at the farm, so to maximize the com-
pany’s proﬁt along the PH. The plan must meet the demand of chicken meat product at the whole-
sale level as well as operational and biosecurity constraints in the farm and slaughterhouse. The
longer the PH the better, as better decisions can be spread taking advantage of seasonal demand
and better sourcing deals.
3. Optimization model for the broiler chicken production problem
We propose an MILP model to solve the broiler chicken production problem. The MILP model
aims at providing optimal production and inventory decisions for the farm and the slaughterhouse,
while observing the demand from the wholesale level and operational constraints. The model will
be described using the order of Fig. 4, which zooms in on Fig. 1. Table 1 summarizes the notation
used in this section.
The model deﬁnition is as follows. Let T be the set of weeks in the time horizon and J the set
of ages of broiler chickens (in weeks). Let H be the set of grow-out houses and H0 the subset of
grow-out houses that are occupied (i.e., not available) at the beginning of the PH. Let S be the set

of sections in the farm and Hs be the subset of grow-out houses of section s ∈ S.F i n a l l y ,l e tR be
the set of walk-in cold rooms at the slaughterhouse.
The integrated operation starts with the day-old chicken lot orders that arrive every week to the
farm. The number of day-old chickens in the lot should be greater than a minimum order quantity
parameter Qmin. The lot is then assigned to one or more grow-out houses h ∈ H, considering its
minimum and maximum occupancy, which are the parametersKmin
h and Kmax
h , respectively. Chicken
lots of diﬀerent ages can be assigned to grow-out houses of the same sections ∈ S, but the diﬀerence
between lot ages can be at most Jmax
s weeks. After chickens are sent to the slaughterhouse, grow-
out houses need to be cleaned and rested during at least Lmin weeks; on the other hand, a grow-out
house cannot be idle for more than Lmax weeks. In the ﬁrst weeks of the PH, the values of some

for cleaning.
The chicken lot that arrives to the slaughterhouse is diminished by the mortality rateF . Chickens
are slaughtered and the yield is given by the parameter W . The chicken product is then stored in
cold rooms. In the ﬁrst week, there is an inventory of I0 at the slaughterhouse; then, at any given
time, there should be a minimum safety stock given byImin. The parameters Imax
r and Imax represent
the maximum inventory capacity of every cold roomr ∈ R and of the slaughterhouse, respectively.
The demand is known for every week and it is denoted by the parameter Dt. The parameter Co
denotes the unitary ordering cost of day-old chickens. Parameters Cu
h and Cc
h are the ﬁxed costs of
using and cleaning a grow-out house, respectively. The costCu
h includes mostly salaries and supplies
to workers; and the costCc
h includes disinfection and sanitization supplies. The parameterC f
tj is the
unitary cost of maintaining (fattening) chickens of agej ∈ J in week t ∈ T and includes the cost of
feed and vaccines. In general, in the poultry cost structure, the feed costs account roughly for 70%
of the operation cost, thusC f
tj is modeled with ﬁner detail to capture cost variations per week along
the PH. Finally, parameterVt denotes the revenue per unit of chicken product on weekt ∈ T .
The model decides with variable qt the size of the day-old chicken lot that arrives on weekt ∈ T .

slaughtering operations (2)–(4) along the PH. The group of constraints (5) assures that the order
size at any given week is larger than or equal to the minimum order size. Since the last lot considered
should be ready for slaughtering at the end of the PH, we can only order until period|T |− (|J |−
1). The set of constraints (6) assigns the day-old chicken of the arriving lot to the grow-out houses
every week.
The set of constraints (7) guarantees that the age diﬀerence within a section is less than or equal to
the maximum allowed. For the sake of clarity, Fig. 5 illustrates this constraint through an example
with |J |= 6a n dJmax
s = 1. Let the ﬁrst row represent an assignment at grow-out househ in week t,
then the constraint checks for the other grow-out housesh′ in the same section s, that the maximum
diﬀerence between ages of chickens in that section is one week. This indicates that we can assign
chickens in that section on t + 1 but not on t + 2,..., t + 5.

Fig. 6. Graphical representation of the inventory and cold rooms management modeled through constraint (24).
Constraints (8) and (10) guarantee that if a grow-out house is used, the amount of assigned
chickens should satisfy a minimum occupancy level. Constraint groups (9) and (11) assure that the
amount of chickens assigned is less than or equal to the maximum capacity of the grow-out houses.
If a grow-out house is being used, new chicken assignments are possible after it is freed from the
current lot and sanitized. Constraints (12) guarantee that at a given time period a grow-out house
could be either receiving chickens, maintaining chickens, being cleaned, or idle.
For sanitation purposes, the set of constraints (13) enforces a minimum number of weeks of
cleaning for each grow-out house just after a lot of chickens has been sent to the slaughterhouse.
The constraint group (14) assures that any grow-out house should not exceedLmax weeks of clean-
ing and resting after the fattening stage.
The set of constraints (15) assures that in the ﬁrst weeks, the model does not assign chickens older
than t. For instance, the model forbids to maintain chickens three-week old in the second week of
the PH. Constraints (16) assure the resting period of grow-out houses in the ﬁrst weeks that is ﬁxed
with parameter Y 0c
th . The set of constraints (17) guarantees that no more grow-out houses can be
assigned to a section in the ﬁrst weeks if this assignment violates the biosecurity conditions with
parameter Y 0a
th . Constraint group (18) assigns chickens of diﬀerent ages in the ﬁrst week according
to the initial assignment conditions of the farm. In summary, constraints (15)–(18) allow us to
initialize the model with a snapshot of the current conditions in the farm.
We model the chicken life cycle with constraints (19) assuring that, when assigned, chickens are
going to grow through the weeks until they reach the slaughter weight (at age |J |). Constraints
(20) guarantee that there are no more assignments of chickens in the farm in the last weeks of the
PH because they would not reach maturity. The set of constraints (21) guarantees that the number
of chickens that leave the grow-out house are converted to kilograms of chicken meat product
accounting for the mortality rate.
In the slaughterhouse, chicken meat products are stored in walk-in cold rooms. Constraint group
(22) enforces the minimum weekly inventory. Constraints (23) assure that the ﬁrst cold room is
always in operation. Constraints (24) guarantee that cold rooms are activated depending on the
inventory levels. Figure 6 shows an illustrative example with three cold rooms, each one of them

with a capacity of 100 kg, and an inventory in the fourth period of I4 = 150. For this case, the ﬁrst
two cold rooms should be operating and the third cold room should be powered oﬀ, so variables
z41 and z42 will take the value of 1, while variablez43 will take the value of 0.
Finally, with constraints (25) for the ﬁrst week and (26) for the remaining ones, we guarantee that
the inventory of meat (chicken product) at the end of a time period is given by the initial inventory,
plus the newly slaughtered chicken coming from the farm, minus the demanded chicken product at
the sales points. Constraints (27)–(33) deﬁne the nature of the decision variables.
4. Case study: a vertically integrated poultry supply chain in Santa Marta (Colombia)
We applied the proposed optimization model using real data from a medium-sized company in
Santa Marta (Colombia) called Pollos Altair. The company handles 80,000 chickens at any given
time in the farm and a daily production of more than 2,000 chickens in the slaughterhouse. The
company was involved in the model deﬁnition phase providing constant feedback and reality
checks. Some of the critical and practical requirements, explicitly asked by the company manage-
ment, consisted in handling biosecurity constraints, initial conditions, and maximum resting times
in grow-out houses, among other conditions. The model was reﬁned through an iterative process
with periodic meetings with the company’s management.
The company provided 30 months of data records (from January 2016 to June 2018) on the
farm scheduling and slaughterhouse operations. Jointly with the company, we estimated parameters
such as, but not limited to, costs, allowed chicken density, inventory limits, size of day-old chicken
lots, and chicken-to-meat conversion rates. To estimate demand, we used production and inventory
l e v e l sa n daf o r e c a s tb a s e do nh i s t o r i cd a t a .
The company sends in advance its yearly poultry production plan to the hatchery. This informa-
tion ﬂow allows the hatchery to align its production plan and improve the supply chain performance
from the supplier end. However, during the year, the plan is updated every six months and the com-
pany is allowed to make minor modiﬁcations to the plan three months in advance of the housing
date. For benchmark purposes, we created four instances with 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month PHs from
two datasets with records starting in December 2016 and December 2017 labeled as Altair01 and
Altair02, respectively.
To illustrate the model inputs, let us consider a smaller instance depicted in Fig. 7. It represents
the state of the farm with 11 grow-out houses distributed in ﬁve sections at the beginning of the PH.
Note that some sections (e.g., Section C) have allocated lots of chicken of diﬀerent ages. Within sec-
tions, chickens of one or two consecutive ages are allowed to coexist. Also, if a grow-out house is
empty, it could be either idle or being cleaned. After solving the model, the company aims for a de-
tailed production plan at the farm and the inventory management decisions at the slaughterhouse,
which could lead to the best possible proﬁt while meeting all business constraints.
5. Computational results and analysis
We implemented the model using Pyomo 5.6.2.dev0 (Hart et al., 2017) library for Python 3.7 and
Gurobi 9.0.2 as the MILP solver (Gurobi Optimization, 2020). We ran all experiments on a 7th

Generation AMD A10 2.40 GHz computer with 8 GB RAM, 10 processors (4 CPU+ 6G P Uc o r e s )
and 64-bit architecture on Windows 10. We set the solver parameters to use at most four threads;
and the termination criteria was either a time limit of 84,600 seconds (1 day) or an optimality gap
of 1%, 3%, 5%, and 10% for the 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month instances, respectively.
5.1. Decision support system
We developed a Microsoft (MS) Excel-based decision support system to communicate the output
of the models to the farm managers and to facilitate the implementation of the model’s output.
Figure 8 represents a 13-week (three-month) schedule for the farm operations of the illustrative
example shown in Fig. 7. The columns in the table represent weeks, while rows represent a com-
bination of section (A, B, C, D, or E) and grow-out house sequence (1 , 2,... ). Observing a given
column, we could know the current state of the farm for a given week. For instance, observing
column “01,” we note that in the ﬁrst week grow-out houses A1 and D1 are idle; 4100 chicken
at grow-out house A2 are ready to be sacriﬁced; and an incoming lot of 2068 day-old chickens
from the hatchery is allocated to grow-out house D2. If we focus on a row, for instance D2, we
see what happens to the grow-out house along the PH. Note that the incoming lot of chickens in
grow-out house D2 is raised and gets ready to be slaughtered in week 6. Then, the grow-out house
gets cleaned in weeks 7 and 8, and becomes idle starting from week 9. This output was produced
with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) automation in MS-Excel and helped us communicate the
proposed production plan to the farm managers. Based on this output, they quickly checked if the
results were coherent and helped us discuss model changes.

Figure 9 shows the second representation of the schedule shown in Fig. 8, which allows farm
managers to communicate with employees in charge of implementing the model’s output. In Fig. 9,
the solution for the illustrative example is translated into a tactical format that includes relevant in-
formation per week, including the assigned grow-out house, date of arrival, area, density, quantities
of chickens, range of dates for slaughtering, demand, and inventory. Another output of the decision
support system is a chart of the inventory level at any given time of the PH (depicted in Fig. 10).
Note that the optimization process pushes down inventory, fulﬁlling the minimum requirement
level and using as few cold rooms as possible.

minutes, 50 minutes, and 2.2 hours, respectively. These times are acceptable due to the strategic and
tactical level of the decisions.
To understand what drives the signiﬁcant improvements against the manual planning approach,
we delved into the cost structure of the solutions for the benchmark instances. Figure 11 shows
the relative cost variation against the manual approach, breaking up the costs for each instance of
each dataset (family of instances). Note that cost reductions come mostly from a better inventory
management. To a less extent, these cost savings come from ordering and fattening decisions. The
reduction in inventory costs ranges from 30% to 60%; while the reduction in ordering and fattening
costs reaches up to 3% and 4%, respectively. This means that less chicken is bought and fattened,
and ultimately kept in inventory. These cost improvements come at the expense of higher housing
and cleaning costs. However, it is worth highlighting that for some instances we found that the
original production plan violated the biosecurity standards, which is understandable because they
are very hard to meet manually. For example, the original 12-month production plans that the
company executed for the periods included in the
Altair01 and Altair02 datasets had 16% and
23% of assignments violating biosecurity conditions, respectively. On the contrary, the model did
not allow biosecurity violations, shifting the company away of an overly expensive risk exposure.
5.3. Rolling-horizon heuristic
In general, time-based optimization models present a myopic behavior in the last time periods of
the PH. As the foresight is restricted to the last time period of the calendar, decisions are made
without considering future periods beyond the end of the PH. In our case study, such behavior
shows in Fig. 10 by model decisions carrying the inventory to the lowest possible level at the end
of the PH. This low inventory and farm conﬁguration at the end are less than ideal as they put the
company at risk as initial conditions are harsh for future planning cycles (i.e., next optimization
run).

Fig. 12. Representation of the rolling-horizon approach.
A common practice in industry to address this problem is to feed the model with a forecast of
additional time periods under an RH approach (Sethi and Sorger, 1991). The idea behind the RH
is to make decisions for a (long) PH by solving a series of linked smaller optimization models with
shorter planning cycles (Sahin et al., 2013). Although an RH approach yields a heuristic solution
for the long PH, it is suitable for addressing the myopic behavior, scalability, and even stochastic
demand scenarios (Silvente et al., 2015).
For the implementation of the RH approach we deﬁne (a) the (long) PH; (b) the shorter equally
sized RH for each of the smaller MILP models; and (c) a control horizon (CH), which is a fraction
of the RH where the smaller MILP models build (ﬁx) part of the ﬁnal solution for the PH. The
RH approach iteratively solves smaller MILP models as follows. First, we solve a smaller MILP
over the ﬁrst RH and save the decisions of the ﬁrst periods over the CH. The state of the system
at the end of the ﬁrst CH is used to initialize the model for the second RH. This process continues
by sliding the RH over the PH, solving smaller MILP models over RH, and ﬁxing the solution for
the CH. At the end, to cover all the PH with the CH, the last RH needs to extend over additional
dummy time periods. Figure 12 shows schematically an example of the RH approach with a PH of
6 months (26 weeks), RH of 3 months (13 weeks), and CH of 5 weeks (except for the last one).
To test the beneﬁts of the RH approach, we solved the instances with the longer 9- and 12-month
PHs for the
Altair01 and Altair02 datasets, using 13-week RH. Figure 13 compares the RH
heuristic against the MILP (henceforth called the single-run MILP) in terms of solution quality
and computing time. On the left axis, the clustered columns show the improvement of the single-
run MILP and the RH heuristic compared against the manual housing and slaughtering plan used
by the company. On the
Altair01 dataset, the improvements for the single-run MILP for the 12-
and 9-month horizon are 42.8% and 36.5%, whereas the RH heuristic improves the manual plan by
24.3% and 14.4%. Similarly, on the
Altair02 dataset, the improvements for the single-run MILP
for the 12- and 9-month horizon are 28.3% and 22.8%, whereas the RH heuristic improves the
manual plan by 12.9% and 4.7%. However, the better improvements of the single-run MILP come at
a computational price. On the right axis (in logarithmic scale), the markers show the time in seconds
for the single-run (×)a n dt h eR H(+). On the
Altair01 dataset, the solution time for the single-run
MILP for the 12- and 9-month horizon are 6456.8 and 2903.8 seconds, respectively, whereas the RH
heuristic takes just 14.9 and 7.3 seconds. Similarly, on the
Altair02 dataset, the solution time for
the single-run MILP for the 12- and 9-month horizon are 7690.4 and 2895.5 seconds, respectively,

whereas the RH heuristics only takes 4.6 and 3.9 seconds. Thus, on the computational side, an
advantage of the RH heuristic is that it takes less than 15 seconds to solve, whereas a single-run
MILP can take a few hours.
For further understanding, we delved into the solution of the single-run MILP solved for the
entire PH and compared it against that of the RH heuristic. For illustrative purposes, Fig. 14 shows
such diﬀerences for the 12-month instance in dataset
Altair01. Figure 14a shows that the inventory
of kilograms of broiler chicken in the RH heuristic is kept low with respect to the single-run MILP,
except for the last weeks (50–52). Because the RH heuristic sees more demand on weeks that go
beyond the PH, it chooses to keep more inventory to satisfy it. Such protective behavior eﬀectively
addresses the short-sighted view of the single-run MILP . At ﬁrst glance, it also seems that the RH
heuristic performs better due to greater savings in inventory costs. Nonetheless, the maintenance
cost increases in the RH heuristic because roughly less chickens are assigned to more grow-out
houses. This is supported by Fig. 14b, which shows the number of six-week-old chickens for every
week and by Fig. 14c, which shows the number of grow-out houses that hold six-week-old chickens.
For example, in week 11, though the amount of birds in both single-run MILP and RH heuristic are
very similar, the number of grow-out houses needed by the RH heuristic to allocate the chickens
is larger. In total, 13 more grow-out houses are used by the RH heuristic for this instance, thus
increasing the ﬁxed costs in comparison to the single-run MILP .
Lastly, we evaluated ﬁnancially the implementation of the RH heuristic in the company. Even
though the improvement by the RH heuristic is lower than the single-run MILP, the return on
investment (ROI) with one year of use is at least 11%. To compute this ROI, we considered the
beneﬁts expressed by the gains against the hand-based solution and the cost of a commercial solver
license, equipment, and salaries to run the project for that year. In summary, this optimization-
based decision support system is self-sustainable and pays oﬀ.
5.4. Demand sensitivity analysis
Demand is a critical parameter in any production planning system and this is no exception for
the broiler chicken supply chain. Fortunately, the decision support tool allows the company to

explore diﬀerent “what-if” scenarios to measure the impact on proﬁt as demand ﬂuctuates. Fig-
ure 15 shows how the prescriptive actions of the model vary as we change the demand for the six-
month instance of dataset
Altair01. We compare two scenarios (low- and high-demand) against a
baseline case (expected demand). The low-demand (high-demand) scenario reduces (increases) by
10% the expected demand (baseline) in the last half of the PH.
Figure 15a and b shows the weekly inventory levels and the number of chickens ready for slaugh-
ter, suggested by the MILP for the three scenarios. Under high demand, more chickens are fattened
in the farms and inventory is kept under control. In contrast, under a low-demand scenario, less
chickens are fattened, but inventories are kept high. Comparing against the baseline case, the high-
demand scenario increases proﬁt by 6%, while the low-demand scenario reduces proﬁt by 7%.

Altair01.
Although demand is inherently deterministic in the proposed MILP, the decision support tool
allows the company to relax this assumption and evaluate diﬀerent scenarios based on demand
changes leading to better informed decisions. As expected, the MILP model conveniently adjusts
production plans that are sensitive to demand ﬂuctuations. In addition, the RH heuristic (Sec-
tion 5.3) provides an eﬀective adaptive strategy to adjust the production plan as more reliable de-
mand estimates unveil. In this way, available demand estimations at the beginning of the PH can be
used for an initial aggregate plan and future adjusted demand estimations could be used within a
RH heuristic as more accurate data reveals over time.
6. Conclusions
In this paper, we developed an MILP model (single-run MILP) that determines a suitable way to or-
der and assign chicken lots for the integrated operations of farms and slaughterhouses in the broiler
chicken supply chain. The model maximizes proﬁt and considers the customer demand observed at
the wholesale level, initialization conditions at the farm, homogeneity of chicken ages in sections,
the mortality rate of chickens, cleaning times of grow-out houses, and inventory and production

decisions at the slaughterhouse. Although these considerations add complexity to the integrated
planning of poultry chicken production, the proposed model is capable of solving instances with
several grow-out houses and sections in a mid-term PH.
We validated the model with a medium-sized poultry company that operates in Santa Marta
(Colombia). The company provided us with real data and manual plans with biosecurity risks (i.e.,
shorter cleaning times and mixed ages). The results showed potential proﬁt improvements ranging
from nearly 7% up to 57%, while still meeting biosecurity standards. As assignment costs may
rise due to stringent constraints, inventory costs can be reduced by more than 40%. Therefore, the
vertical integration proved to be beneﬁcial as the common goal is achieved with fewer resources.
Additional beneﬁts of using an optimization-based decision support system in this agri-chain
come in terms of solution quality, feasibility of the plans, “what-if” analysis on sensitive parameters
(e.g., demand), and savings in management time. The model was able to produce a tactical solution
for a 52-week PH in less than 2.2 hours; and the plan can be adjusted for a 13-week PH in less than
am i n u t e .
Furthermore, we propose an RH heuristic as an alternative to cope with the myopic inventory
decisions at the end of the PH and to reduce the computational burden of long-term time-indexed
planning models, such as the single-run MILP . The computational experiments show an acceptable
trade-oﬀ between speed and accuracy comparing the RH heuristic against the single-run MILP
model over the year-long PH. The reduction in computational times (from a couple of hours to
less than a minute) makes the RH approach a fair alternative if the MILP model for the entire
PH becomes hard to solve. Evidently, if resources are available (e.g., commercial solver capability
and time), in terms of proﬁt improvement potential it is preferred to use the single-run MILP
with the mentioned caveat on the myopic decisions made at the last time periods of the horizon.
Alternatively, the fast and scalable RH heuristic is a very good option, competitive against the
single-run MILP and superior to the hand-based solution. To relax the deterministic assumptions
of the MILP, a sensitivity analysis over diﬀerent scenarios allows the company to measure the
impact on proﬁt to demand ﬂuctuations. Finally, we discuss how the proposed RH heuristic can be
used to dynamically adjust the production plan as better demand estimations reveals.
Research currently underway focuses on relaxing some of the deterministic assumptions used
herein. As we found the model sensitive to demand forecast, incorporating uncertainty could lead
to a more robust planning. In the case study, prices of resources and products are steady because
of the year-round availability of resources and the tropical weather without seasons. However, this
might not be the case in other regions worldwide. Another source of variation comes from the
weight gain of birds that might reach maturity at diﬀerent weeks. Therefore, addressing ﬂuctuations
in demand, resources, prices, and weight gain is certainly an important research line. Finally, the
integration with more echelons of the supply chain (e.g., chicken feed suppliers) could increase the
proﬁt margin for the companies in this highly competitive meat market.
